# LICENSE

I am going to write my own license, because I feel like it?

---

## Section 1. I will not sue you

I promise I will not sue you, you can believe me because honestly I am not rich enough to sue anybody.

I don't even know if writing my own license is legally a thing or not, but whatever, because I am not gonna sue you.

---

## Section 2. You can't sue me either

Ok so I guess this is just for my personal safety, but if my code ends up setting your fish tank on fire or something else thats also entirely horrible you can't sue me.

You are allowed to send me angry emails, but you consent to not suing me by using my code.

## Section 3. Notice me senpai

Eh, spirit of sharing and what not, if you can acknowledge that I, `ms-jpq` wrote this it would be very nice.

But I don't really like my Github name anyways, its one of those named I picked when I still thought MapleStory was a good game.

Its too late to change now though.
